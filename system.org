#+TITLE: System Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Xavier Capaldi
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :results silent

There are several great systems for managing configurations including [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].
However they are still a little confusing to use and you fundamentally need to track which configuration is relevant for which part of your system.
Given org-mode's capable source blocks, the entire system installation and configuration can be contained in a single file and then the relevant configs tangled out. 
Similar to a systems options panel in XFCE, you can control all parameters of your system directly from this file, keeping a record as you go.
The only exception is the window manager which typically has its own method of configuration.

* installation
Start with a Fedora network installer.
Select the minimal installation with no addons.
If you're doing this at McGill, you'll need to use ethernet with the following settings:
- IP: 132.206.186.65
- netmask: 255.255.255.0
- gateway: 132.206.186.1
- dns nameservers: 132.206.44.21, 132.216.44.21

Make sure you set a root password and a user with administrative privileges.

** disk partitioning
Be careful with automatic partitioning.
I've found it won't use the whole hard drive unless instructed.

- Click custom partitioning and click the old partition tree and then the minus.
- Delete everything.
- Then click "automatically generate new partitioning scheme."
- Look at the details and look at the / partition (which is home).
- It will be very small (15 GiB).
- Change it to a number larger than your remaining space and it will automatically increase appropriately.

After the install you can log into the tty.

** remove splash screen
This is personal preference but I like seeing the boot sequence.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf remove plymouth-*
#+END_SRC

* git
Git is necessary to pull the configuration files.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install git
  git config --global user.name "Xavier Capaldi"
  git config --global user.email xcapaldi@scribo.biz
#+END_SRC

Now you can pull the config.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/xcapaldi/dotfiles.git emacs
#+END_SRC

* emacs
Emacs is the first and most important priority as it allows the running of source blocks from this file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install emacs
#+END_SRC

The first time running emacs -nw (since you don't have a windowing system yet), emacs will install the full configuration.
This will allow you to progress through the remainder of the installation in emacs.

* package repositories
DNF is a nice package manager but is known for being a little slow.
We can force it to use the fastest mirrors by modifying its configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "fastestmirror=True" | sudo tee -a /etc/dnf/dnf.conf 
#+END_SRC

** RPM Fusion
A nonfree repo must be added if you want to watch videos.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
  sudo dnf groupupdate multimedia --setop="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin
#+END_SRC

** Flatpak
Flatpak is a containerized application method used by companies to distribute their software to different linux distros without needing to package for the repos.
Ubuntu has their own clone of this technology called Snap.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install flatpak
  flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
#+END_SRC

Install apps:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  flatpak install flathub us.zoom.Zoom
  flatpak install flathub com.valvesoftware.Steam
#+END_SRC

I'm not sure a local spotify app is really any better than the web version.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client
#+END_SRC

Don't install Slack.
It is a terrible electron app.

* graphical display
Install xorg (no wayland for us yet).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-xinit
#+END_SRC

for Intel
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-intel
#+END_SRC

** Changing screen resolutions
While xrandr is technically sufficient, a graphical method of managing displays is very helpful whenever you might be working in an unusual setting or giving a presentation.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install arandr
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can easily script this.

* keybindings
My philosophy is that window manager keybindings can/should be managed by the window manager.
Other keybindings can be managed with an additional program.

xbindkeys and sxhkd are both options but xbindkeys can be configured in guile and thus supports much more complex keybindings.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xbindkeys
#+END_SRC

Certain binds will be reserved by the window manager.
There are also some Mod + mouse button binds.

We will want a few additional binds that are quite simple:
- increase volume
- decrease volume
- max volume
- minimum volume

We don't really need anything else as any additional keybinds just infringe on our memory for more important things.
Since our needs are so minimal, we'll just add the new binds directly to the window manager configuration.

We can also add symlinks to our bin in order to launch more commands from a command palette instead of from memory.

** xbindkeys configuration
This configuration is [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html][guile]]-based.
Any functions that work in guile will work here.
The semicolon is used for comments.

Check how to reference keys with ~xbindkeys --key~ or ~xbindkeys --multikey~.
There is also a list of keys in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h

Check the [[https://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html#configuration][sample configurations]].
xbindkeys is capable of timed-keybinds and modal keychords (like in i3).
Honestly, it is amazing and I'd use it heavily in a window manager like herbstluftwm.

* wifi
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install NetworkManager NetworkManager-wifi iwl7260-firmware
#+END_SRC

Complex configuration requires the applet for the system tray:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install network-manager-applet
#+END_SRC

Need to modify options on wifi card on current laptop:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo echo "options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf
  sudo echo "options iwlwifi swcrypto=1" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf
  sudo echo "options iwlwifi power_save=0" >> /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf
  sudo echo "[connection]\nwifi.powersave = 2" > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
#+END_SRC

* audio control
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install alsa-utils
#+END_SRC

Another option is pulse audio which has much more control.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install pulseaudio
  sudo dnf install pavucontrol
  sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils
#+END_SRC

You can even add an icon to the system tray.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install pasystray
#+END_SRC

* power management
* external drive management
* backlight
You can do this manually but this application makes it very easy:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install brightlight
#+END_SRC

** Manual method
This is very system dependent so best to do manually
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xbacklight
  ls /sys/class/backlight # probably have an intel backlight
  xrandr --verbose
#+END_SRC

Note the identifier from the xrandr call (mine was 0x41).
Now modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  Section "Device"
      Indentifier "0x41"
      Driver "intel"
      Option "Backlight" "intel_backlight"
  EndSection
#+END_SRC

You'll need to reboot for this to take effect.

* fonts
I prefer to install a solid fontset which has monospaced and standard fonts.
Good options are Mozilla's Fira fontset or IBM's Plex fontset.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dnf install mozilla-fira-mono-fonts mozilla-fira-sans-fonts
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install ibm-plex-fonts
#+END_SRC

You should also consider installing an emoji font.
It's not really crucial for an emacs setup since within emacs you can use emojify. 
However if you'd like to rice your bar, an emoji font can be very useful.
Note that just because you have an emoji font does not mean all terminals will support them.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install google-noto-emoji-fonts google-noto-emoji-color-fonts 
#+END_SRC

Alternatively if you want to rice, another option is to install the nerd font for your main font and only use it in the bar.
I suppose if you really like tons of extra symbols and ligatures, you could use the nerd font everywhere. 
I think think it's a bit excessive.
In general I think it is simpler to use these company fonts because they'll have good support over something like DaddyTimeMono.

** International fonts
By default Emacs falls back on symbola so that's a good font to install as a backup.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install gdouros-symbola-fonts
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, to have good international font coverage, you can install the whole set of google noto sans fonts:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install google-noto-sans-*
#+END_SRC

Check the emacs configuration to see how these are listed as options in the config.
Installing the whole set takes ~1Gb of space so you may want to just install the font for a particular language you use often.

* shell
Alias sh to dash instead of bash.
This should speed up posix-compliant scripts.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install dash
  sudo rm /bin/sh
  sudo ln -s /bin/dash /bin/sh
#+END_SRC

* terminal emulator
We try to use the emacs built-in terminal emulators but xterm is a fallback.
Check this [[https://anarc.at/blog/2018-05-04-terminal-emulators-2/][review of terminal emulators]] to see that xterm is actually quite small and has little latency.
In addition, xterm is one of the most compatible terminals with anything that is thrown at it.
This is a desirable trait for a fallback terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xterm
#+END_SRC

Xterm is configured via Xresources.

* videos
These are the best applications for downloading and watching videos.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install ffmpeg youtube-dl mpv
#+END_SRC

* printers
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install cups
#+END_SRC

Setup the printers in the physics department
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  curl -O http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~juan/ppd/number17.ppd
  curl -O http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~juan/ppd/number5.ppd
  curl -O http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~juan/ppd/phaser9.ppd

  sudo mv number17.ppd /etc/cups/ppd
  sudo mv number5.ppd /etc/cups/ppd
  sudo mv phaser9.ppd /etc/cups/ppd

  sudo lpadmin -p number17 -E -v ipp://printserver.physics.mcgill.ca/printers/number17
  sudo lpadmin -p number5 -E -v ipp://printserver.physics.mcgill.ca/printers/number5
  sudo lpadmin -p phaser9 -E -v ipp://printserver.physics.mcgill.ca/printers/phaser9
#+END_SRC

Selinux will have an issue with this so:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo /sbin/restorecon -v /etc/cups/ppd/number17.ppd
  sudo /sbin/restorecon -v /etc/cups/ppd/number5.ppd
  sudo /sbin/restorecon -v /etc/cups/ppd/phaser9.ppd
#+END_SRC

* text editors
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install vim
#+END_SRC

* java
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install icedtea-web
#+END_SRC

* applications
** graphics
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install sxiv inkscape gimp ImageMagick
#+END_SRC

sxiv is amazing and easily rivals image-dired in emacs.
It is like a dmenu of images and can even pipe images.

** CAD
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install freecad
#+END_SRC

** PCB
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install kicad
#+END_SRC

* terminal applications
** critical
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install unzip
#+END_SRC

** other
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install ftp espeak lm_sensors entr task-spooler urlview tree byanz oneko
#+END_SRC

* internet browsers
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install firefox
#+END_SRC

* office
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install libreoffice
#+END_SRC

* PDF
I'll use pdf-tools in emacs but here is documentation for alternatives:

The most minimal is just to use mupdf which is crude at best.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install mupdf
#+END_SRC

A step up is zathura which has some nice features included smooth page transitions, color theming and reading from standard input.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install zathura zathura-pdf-mupdf zathura-djvu
#+END_SRC

Maybe evince?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install evince
#+END_SRC

Or Okular for the most comprehensive PDF editing features.
I believe Okular is the only tool I've found on linux that can do typewriter in a PDF or draw arbitrary lines.
I usually avoid installing it as much as a I can.

* Dropbox
I've always installed it from their [[https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux][rpm package on their website]].
Dropbox doesn't update their repos properly so you'll get constant warning whenever updating or installing packages.
Use the following configuration to use the latest version if available and otherwise falling back on the fedora 32 version which did work.
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle "/sudo::/etc/yum.repos.d/dropbox.repo"
  [dropbox]
  name=Dropbox Repository
  baseurl=https://linux.dropbox.com/fedora/$releasever/
  https://linux.dropbox/fedora/32/
  failovermethod=priority
  gpgkey=https://linux.dropbox.com/fedora/rpm-public-key.asc
#+END_SRC

* system tray
Stalonetray is in the repos (as apposed to trayer) so I use that.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install stalonetray
#+END_SRC

* notifications

      #              invoke it. If there are multiple and no default, open the context menu.
      # * close_current: Close current notification.

      # using the resolution and physical size. This might be useful in setups
      # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.
      per_monitor_dpi = false
#+END_SRC

*** shortcuts
The internal keyboard shorcut support in dunst is now considered deprecated and should be replaced by dunstctl calls
You can use the configuration of your WM or DE to bind these to shortcuts of your choice.
Check the dunstctl manual page for more info.
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  [shortcuts]

      # Shortcuts are specified as [modifier+][modifier+]...key
      # Available modifiers are "ctrl", "mod1" (the alt-key), "mod2",
      # "mod3" and "mod4" (windows-key).
      # Xev might be helpful to find names for keys.

      # Close notification. Equivalent dunstctl command:
      # dunstctl close
      # close = ctrl+space

      # Close all notifications. Equivalent dunstctl command:
      # dunstctl close-all
      # close_all = ctrl+shift+space

      # Redisplay last message(s). Equivalent dunstctl command:
      # dunstctl history-pop
      # history = ctrl+grave

      # Context menu. Equivalent dunstctl command:
      # dunstctl context
      # context = ctrl+shift+period
#+END_SRC

*** urgency
**** low
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  [urgency_low]
      # IMPORTANT: colors have to be defined in quotation marks.
      # Otherwise the "#" and following would be interpreted as a comment.
      background = "#222222"
      foreground = "#888888"
      timeout = 10
      # Icon for notifications with low urgency, uncomment to enable
      #icon = /path/to/icon
#+END_SRC

**** normal
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  [urgency_normal]
      background = "#285577"
      foreground = "#ffffff"
      timeout = 10
      # Icon for notifications with normal urgency, uncomment to enable
      #icon = /path/to/icon
#+END_SRC

**** critical
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  [urgency_critical]
      background = "#900000"
      foreground = "#ffffff"
      frame_color = "#ff0000"
      timeout = 0
      # Icon for notifications with critical urgency, uncomment to enable
      #icon = /path/to/icon
#+END_SRC

*** rules
Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
override settings for certain messages.

Messages can be matched by
   appname (discouraged, see desktop_entry)
   body
   category
   desktop_entry
   icon
   match_transient
   msg_urgency
   stack_tag
   summary

and you can override the
   background
   foreground
   format
   frame_color
   fullscreen
   new_icon
   set_stack_tag
   set_transient
   timeout
   urgency

Shell-like globbing will get expanded.

Instead of the appname filter, it's recommended to use the desktop_entry filter.
GLib based applications export their desktop-entry name.
In comparison to the appname, the desktop-entry won't get localized.

**** scripting
You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
setting the "script" option.
The script will be called as follows:
  script appname summary body icon urgency
where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".

NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format to "".
NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order to find fitting options for rules.

*** transient notifications
Disable the transient hint so that idle_threshold cannot be bypassed from the client:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  #[transient_disable]
  #    match_transient = yes
  #    set_transient = no
#+END_SRC

Make the handling of transient notifications more strict by making them not be placed in history:
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  #[transient_history_ignore]
  #    match_transient = yes
  #    history_ignore = yes
#+END_SRC

*** fullscreen values
show: show the notifications, regardless if there is a fullscreen window opened
delay: displays the new notification, if there is no fullscreen window active
       If the notification is already drawn, it won't get undrawn.
pushback: same as delay, but when switching into fullscreen, the notification will get withdrawn from screen again and will get delayed like a new notification

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  #[fullscreen_delay_everything]
  #    fullscreen = delay
  #[fullscreen_show_critical]
  #    msg_urgency = critical
  #    fullscreen = show
#+END_SRC

*** misc
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc
  #[espeak]
  #    summary = "*"
  #    script = dunst_espeak.sh

  #[script-test]
  #    summary = "*script*"
  #    script = dunst_test.sh

  #[ignore]
  #    # This notification will not be displayed
  #    summary = "foobar"
  #    format = ""

  #[history-ignore]
  #    # This notification will not be saved in history
  #    summary = "foobar"
  #    history_ignore = yes

  #[skip-display]
  #    # This notification will not be displayed, but will be included in the history
  #    summary = "foobar"
  #    skip_display = yes

  #[signed_on]
  #    appname = Pidgin
  #    summary = "*signed on*"
  #    urgency = low
  #
  #[signed_off]
  #    appname = Pidgin
  #    summary = *signed off*
  #    urgency = low
  #
  #[says]
  #    appname = Pidgin
  #    summary = *says*
  #    urgency = critical
  #
  #[twitter]
  #    appname = Pidgin
  #    summary = *twitter.com*
  #    urgency = normal
  #
  #[stack-volumes]
  #    appname = "some_volume_notifiers"
  #    set_stack_tag = "volume"
#+END_SRC

** Fondle
For window managers that come with a minimal bar, I prefer my own notification daemon, [[https://github.com/xcapaldi/fondle][fondle]].
It basically pipes all notifications through the bar and can handle the updating of some status information.
Fondle is a python program and has a few dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo::
  sudo dnf install make python3-gobject gtk3
#+END_SRC

Clone the repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/xcapaldi/fondle.git
#+END_SRC

And install:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo::/home/xavier/src/fondle
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

Fondle is configured via flags at runtime so all the options can be set in [[*xinitrc][xinitrc]]. 

* screenlock
This is the most amazing and trippy screen locker I've seen.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install xlockmore
#+END_SRC

* password management
Pass is really sexy but it isn't easily portable and it seems a bit like reinventing the wheel. 
Keepassxc is a graphical tool with a command-line interface.
It is cross-platform compatible with all operating systems and the password store can be transported as a single database.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install keepassxc
#+END_SRC

There are browser extensions as well for this.

** backup database?
* gpg
Of course I am using a master and subkey strategy for my gpg keys.
This seems to be the best practice these days.
I'll add my references to this section later.
In short, my master key is kept on an offline security drive.
Most actions are performed with my temporary subkeys which I use on the machine. 
To move to a new computer, you can just copy your .gnupg directory over.
Once copied, run the following to set the proper permissions:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  chown -R $(whoami) ~/.gnupg/
  chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
#+END_SRC

* email
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install isync msmtp notmuch emacs-notmuch
#+END_SRC

We will use a gtk pinentry application.
Maybe later we will try to use emacs for this.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo dnf install pinentry-gtk
#+END_SRC

The passwords are stored in gpg-encrypted plain-text files.
Use the following command to encrypt the files:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo::
  gpg --default-recipient-self -e /path/to/plain/password
#+END_SRC

** mbsync                                                            :config:
This takes care of syncing our mail between the server and the computer.

*** database configuration
The only value supported here is 'path' which should be the top-level directory where your mail currently exists and to where mail will be delivered in the future.
Files should be individual email messages.
Notmuch will store its database within a sub-directory of the path configured here named ".notmuch".

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
[database]
path=/home/xavier/.mail
#+END_SRC

*** user configuration
Here is where you can let notmuch know how you would like to be addressed.
Valid settings are

name		Your full name.
primary_email	Your primary email address.
other_email	A list (separated by ';') of other email addresses at which you receive email.

Notmuch will use the various email addresses configured here when formatting replies.
It will avoid including your own addresses in the recipient list of replies, and will set the From address based on the address to which the original email was addressed.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
[user]

primary_email=capaldix@physics.mcgill.ca
other_email=xcapaldi@scribo.biz;beeboy@giftedfleece.com;xavier.capaldi@gmail.com;
#+END_SRC

*** configuration for "notmuch new"
The following options are supported here:

tags	A list (separated by ';') of the tags that will be added to all messages incorporated by "notmuch new".

ignore	A list (separated by ';') of file and directory names that will not be searched for messages by "notmuch new".

	NOTE: *Every* file/directory that goes by one of those names will be ignored, independent of its depth/location	in the mail store.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
[new]
tags=new;
ignore=
#+END_SRC

*** search configuration
The following option is supported here:

exclude_tags
	A ;-separated list of tags that will be excluded from search results by default.
	Using an excluded tag in a query will override that exclusion.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
[search]
exclude_tags=deleted;spam;
#+END_SRC

*** maildir compatibility configuration
The following option is supported here:

synchronize_flags      Valid values are true and false.

If true, then the following maildir flags (in message filenames) will be synchronized with the corresponding notmuch tags:

	Flag	Tag
	----	-------
	D	draft
	F	flagged
	P	passed
	R	replied
	S	unread (added when 'S' flag is not present)

The "notmuch new" command will notice flag changes in filenames and update tags, while the "notmuch tag" and "notmuch restore" commands will notice tag changes and update flags in filenames.

* window manager
I wanted to use DWM but have some issues on Fedora 34 with the compilation.
Spectrwm works quite well as a replacement but I also really wanted to try Herbstluftwm which I think would have a superior workflow for multiple monitors.
After using briefly, I'm not sure the required configuration and added complexity is really worth it.
