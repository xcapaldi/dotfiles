Literate configuration for linux box and emacs.
Since both main configuration files are org-files, you can read them directly on Github.

* system.org
The Fedora system installation and configuration.

* config.org
The emacs-specific configuration.
Whenever possible packages (outside the foundational packages) should be independent so that particular blocks can be disabled or activated without conflict.
I also try, within reason, to use built-in emacs functionality whenever possible.

** Foundational packages
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
- [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] for modular/isolated system configuration
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] for grouped and persistent keybindings
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy/counsel/swiper]] completion framework with related tools (there are several impressive alternatives but currently ivy-bibtex is the only tool that fulfills my needs with my literature database)

** Evil packages
- 😈 [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]] for vim modal editing in emacs
- 🪖 [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general]] for more convenient keybindings when using evil

** Organization packages
- 📅 org-mode for planning, habit tracking, time tracking, . . .

** Appearance
- [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/][modus-themes]] for the best accessible themes in emacs
  
** 📜 Literature/knowledge management packages
- [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][ivy-bibtex]] for rapidly searching papers in library
- [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] for citing in org-mode and automatically generating bibtex references
- [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] for improved pdf-viewer and editor
- [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] for slipbox-style linked knowledge nodes
- [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex][org-roam-bibtex]] integration with org-ref to allow notes on papers
  
** Email
- ✉️ [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] for a search-based email interface
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusAlias][gnus-alias]] for switching between email accounts
  
** Programming
- 👨‍💻 [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] for using LSP to handle almost everything

** To check
- [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]] for fancy completion at point
- 💀 [[https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/][yasnippet]] as an alternative to skeleton for snippets
- [[https://github.com/alphapapa/prism.el][prism.el]] for syntax highlighting based on depth
- 🫖 [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]] as a powerful git porcelain in emacs
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] for project management (built in project also option)
- [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][pyvenv.el]] to manage python virtual environments (maybe in conjunction with [[https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv][pyenv]])
- [[https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el][dimmer.el]] to highlight which buffer is active
- ✒️ [[https://github.com/raxod502/blackout][blackout]] to cleanup modeline
- 🎂 [[https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy][lispy]] for modal editing of lisps
- 🍎 [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][cider]] for interactive development of clojure in emacs
- [[https://github.com/karthink/popper][popper]] to handle small buffers
- [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] rapidly jump to regions in buffer
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][embark]] for contextual actions

* TODO mac-config.org
Emacs configuration for mac system.
