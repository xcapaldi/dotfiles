Literate configuration for Linux and Mac boxes and emacs.
Since most configuration files are org-files, you can read them directly on Github.

* dotfiles.org
Non-emacs dotfiles for both Linux and Mac.
They are conditionally tangled to the appropriate locations from code blocks.
The Macos portion is still incomplete.

* config.org
The emacs-specific configuration.
Whenever possible, packages (outside the foundational packages) should be independent so that particular blocks can be disabled or activated without conflict.
I also try, within reason, to use built-in emacs functionality whenever possible.
The configuration differs slightly between my Linux and Mac boxes.
I take advantage of =use-package='s ~:if~ to only load packages on the appropriate system.
A few key points of the configuration:

- 📏 [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
- 📦 [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] for modular/isolated system configuration
- 🍵 [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]] as a powerful git porcelain in emacs
- ☮️ hippie-expand for dynamic expansions
- 🪗 abbrev and expand for simple expansions and templates
- 💀 skeleton with customizations for advanced snippets
- 🪞 [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] for grouped and persistent keybindings
- 🪢 vertico/consult/embark/orderless minimal completion framework with extensions
- 📅 org-mode for planning, habit tracking, time tracking, ...
- 🎨 [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/][modus-themes]] for the best accessible themes in emacs
- 👨‍💻 [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] for using LSP to handle almost everything
- ⏳ project.el for project management
- 🐱 [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][meow]] as a modal editing interface

I am considering migrating away from the literate configuration.
I will evaluate how much is really gained from the comments.

* fedora.org
A setup guide for my Fedora Linux box.
In particular it contains a special section on setting up a minimal system.
It takes advantage of Fedora's package manager's (DNF's) transactions to install groups of packages at once.
The packages for setting up a minimal system are listed in =setup-dnffile=.
All the other packages I always want are listed in =dnffile=.
This is intentionally similar to the =brewfile= on Macos.

* Core tools
- Emacs
- Browser (Firefox)
- Terminal (xterm)
  Whenever possible, I try to use the emacs built-in terminal emulators but I need a fallback.
  Check this [[https://anarc.at/blog/2018-05-04-terminal-emulators-2/][review of terminal emulators]] to see that xterm is actually quite small and has little latency.
  In addition, xterm is one of the most compatible terminals with anything that is thrown at it.
  This is a desirable trait for a fallback terminal.

* Linux box
Currently my linux box is running Fedora with DWM.
My DWM "config" has its [[https://github.com/xcapaldi/dwm][own repository]] but it is not particular special.
It just contains some small modifications and (soon) patches.
